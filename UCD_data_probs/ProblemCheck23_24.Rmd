## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#loading libraries
library(tidyverse)

MP20240908 <- read_csv("UCD_mort_pheno_20240908_corrected_dataprobs.csv") #try different .csv
  #remove spaces in column names
  names(MP20240908) <- gsub(" ", "", colnames(MP20240908))

  #check for spaces in numbers
  MP20240908spaces <- MP20240908  %>% filter(grepl(" ", diam.mm) | grepl(" ", num.flw) | grepl(" ", num.fruitordate.collected) | 
                             grepl(" ", long.fruit.cm) | grepl(" ", total.branch) | 
                             grepl(" ", overhd.diam) | grepl(" ", overhd.perp)) %>%
    mutate(problem="spaces")
  
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
getwd()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
