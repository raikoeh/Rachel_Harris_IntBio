# Examples

-   Figure updates:

    -   Sort “over time” figures by date (convert from character to date, Brandie can demonstrate)

    -   Error bars on mean TDR per bed bar plot (Brandie can share some code for this)

    -   Bar plot for mean TDR per position (+ error bars)

    -   Compare Bed\*Pos over time

        -   Example Top of Bed A vs Top of Bed B (similar to the boxplot you made)

## Libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse) #for easy data manipulations 
library(corrplot) #plotting correlations and getting the significance of correlations 

sem <- function(x, na.rm=FALSE) {           #for calculating standard error
  sd(x,na.rm=na.rm)/sqrt(length(na.omit(x)))
} 
```

## Example of converting Date characters to actual dates 
```{r}
dummy_dates <- tibble(Date=c("10/16/25", "8/16/25", "7/4/25")) #make a data frame with some dates
dummy_dates #these dates are "characters" according to R right now 

dummy_dates %>% 
  mutate(Date_2=mdy(Date)) #convert those dates to the date format - we used mdy here because our dates are in the month/day/year format 
```


## Example for error bars
```{r}
wl2_establishment <- read_csv("../input/WL2_Establishment.csv") #data for survival 3 weeks post-transplant in 2023 at WL2
head(wl2_establishment) #look at first few rows 

wl2_est_summary <- wl2_establishment %>% 
  group_by(bed) %>% #summarize by bed 
  summarise(meanSurv=mean(Establishment, na.rm=TRUE), #calculate the mean of establishment
            semSurv=sem(Establishment, na.rm=TRUE))  #calculate the standard error of establishment using the function at the top of this script ("sem")
wl2_est_summary

wl2_est_summary %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=fct_reorder(bed, meanSurv), y=meanSurv)) + #fct_reorder just reorders the beds on the x axis according to their mean establishment 
  geom_col(width = 0.7,position = position_dodge(0.75)) + #make a bar plot 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=meanSurv-semSurv, ymax=meanSurv+semSurv), #add error bars 
                width=.2, position = position_dodge(0.75)) + #give the error bars some properties to match the bars
  theme_classic() + 
  labs(x="Bed", y="Establishment") #label the x and y axis 


## make the same plot as above but filter first
wl2_est_summary %>% 
  filter(bed=="A" | bed=="B") %>% #only keep beds A and B, you could do position == "Top" for example 
  ggplot(aes(x=fct_reorder(bed, meanSurv), y=meanSurv)) +
  geom_col(width = 0.7,position = position_dodge(0.75)) + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=meanSurv-semSurv,ymax=meanSurv+semSurv),width=.2, position = 
                  position_dodge(0.75)) + 
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x="Bed", y="Establishment", title="Top") #add a title to indicate what position you filtered by 
```

1.  Test for a correlation between TDR and MetStation when the data overlaps

    1.  Correlation test with mean MetStation soil moisture for summer 2024 and mean TDR for each Bed for 2024

    2.  Calculate the difference from the Metstation sensor to see how that varies over time and across positions of TDR measurements (can make figures where the y axis is the difference) 
    
```{r}
wl2_cors <- wl2_establishment %>% 
  select(GrwSsn_GD_Recent, GrwSsn_GD_Historical) #make a dataframe with just the columns you want to correlate

cor.norm = cor(wl2_cors) #test correlations among the traits
cor.norm
cor.sig <- cor.mtest(wl2_cors, method = "pearson") #getting the p-values for correlations 
cor.sig
```

```{r}
test_metdata <- tibble(Date=c("10/16/25", "8/16/25", "7/4/25"), #tibble allows you to make new data frames 
                    MetStation_moisture=c(0, 0, 0.2))
test_metdata

test_TDRdata <- tibble(Date=c("10/16/25", "8/16/25", "7/4/25", "10/16/25", "8/16/25", "7/4/25"),
                       Bed = c("A", "A","A", "B", "B", "B"),
                       Pos = c("Top","Top","Top","Top","Top","Top"),
                       TDR = c(0, 0, 0.2, 0, 0, 0.2))
test_TDRdata

merge_test <- left_join(test_TDRdata, test_metdata) %>% #merge the metstation and TDR data, by using left_join and having the TDR listed first, it will duplicate the metstation data to line up with the TDR data according to the Date column 
  mutate(Moisture_dif = MetStation_moisture-TDR) #calcualte the difference between each of the TDR measurements and the MetStation soil moisture 
merge_test
```
