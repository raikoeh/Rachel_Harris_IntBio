## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#merging genotypes and biomass based on their two shared columns "unique.ID" and "blocks"
Merged_GT_BMB <- left_join(Genotypes_2023_2024, Biomass_Blocks_Biomass_Blocks, by = c("unique.ID", "block"))

```

## Including Plots


```{r}
#box plot for correlation between population and biomass
Merged_GT_BMB %>% 
  filter(pop.id=="middle") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=pop.id, y=total.biomass_g)) +
  geom_col(width = 0.7,position = position_dodge(0.75)) + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=mean_TDR-sem_TDR,ymax=mean_TDR+sem_TDR),width=.2, position = 
                  position_dodge(0.75)) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(text=element_text(size=25)) + #making the text bigger 
  labs(x="Bed", y="Mean TDR", title="All Beds at Middle Position")
ggsave("../output/MeanTDRMiddleBeds.png", width = 12, height = 8, units = "in")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
