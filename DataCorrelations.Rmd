## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(corrplot)

```


```{r}
#merging genotypes and biomass based on their two shared columns "unique.ID" and "blocks"
Merged_GT_BMB <- left_join(Genotypes_2023_2024, Biomass_Blocks_Biomass_Blocks, by = c("unique.ID", "block"))

```

## Including Plots

```{r}
#filtering out data before boxplot
CMerged_GT_BMB <- Merged_GT_BMB %>% 
  filter(!is.na(total.biomass_g))
```


```{r}
#box plot for correlation between population and biomass
CMerged_GT_BMB %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=pop.id, y=total.biomass_g)) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.7,position = position_dodge(0.75)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ `Plant Type`, scales = "free_x") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x="Population", y="Biomass", title="Population vs Biomass") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust =1, size = 11), text=element_text(size=20))
ggsave("output/Population vs Biomass.png", width = 20, height = 8, units = "in")

#column plot for population and average biomass
CMerged_GT_BMB %>% 
  group_by(pop.id) %>% 
  summarise(mean_biomass = mean(total.biomass_g, na.rm =TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=pop.id, y=mean_biomass)) +
  geom_col(width = 0.7,position = position_dodge(0.75)) + 
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x="Population", y="Average Biomass", title="Population vs Average Biomass") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust =1, size = 11), text=element_text(size=20))
ggsave("output/Population vs Average Biomass.png", width = 20, height = 8, units = "in")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
